# DOOM — Gravitational Rendering Engine

DOOM is a real-time GPU-based black hole visualization and spacetime distortion simulator built using Python and OpenGL shaders.

The project focuses on visually accurate gravitational lensing, accretion disk rendering, and relativistic space distortion.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- ModernGL
- OpenGL (GLSL Shaders)
- GPU Fragment Rendering

## Goal
Build a real-time astrophysical visualization engine capable of simulating extreme spacetime phenomena.
